The bonuses we implemented are:
- Lights in the scene graph
	This is simply that our lights are an extention of the node class.
- Lights move during runtime

We used the slides as our source, other than that we haven't used any sources. 

DOCUMENTATION
=============
We implemented a scenegraph, which is based on a node tree. Said node tree contains two types of nodes, the 'normal' model nodes and the light nodes. These nodes are shown on launch in the tree format, like a file explorer.

Furthermore we have a few controls, these are all from the viewpoint of the camera.
W	- Rotate downwards
A	- Rotate to the left
S	- Rotate upwards
D	- Rotate to the right
Shift	- Move up
Space	- Move down
Up	- Move forwards
Down	- Move downwards
Left	- Move to the left
Right	- Move to the right
